DONE [83:a6c333464330] Use spin locks for scheduling strategies.
DONE [179:c228b05b2d32] Clean obsolete classes (Server_stack, Server_server). Place relevant classes into a common header file (Socket, Server_socket, Client_socket, Web_socket into socket.hh).
DONE [184:b3afe82e233a] Remove non-portable WebSocket dependencies on memchr, bzero and other fancy functions.

DONE [297:67e9297e83d0] Add IPv6 support through 'struct sockaddr_storage'.
DONE [297:67e9297e83d0] Replace inet_ntop, inet_pton with C++ analogs, possibly with IPv6 support.

NOT NEEDED [complicates current API] Specialise Bytes class for fixed size arrays.

Add IPv6 support: rewrite discover_neighbours() to support large networks scanning.
Make logs machine-readable (prepend process ID, thread ID. date and time, object the log record refers to) and accessible through --verbose (-v) option.
Make servers and all other pointer entities move-constructible to reduce possibility of bad memory address access errors.
Implement thread affinity through pthread library with fall back to native OS calls.
Remove stale connections from Socket_server.
Remove stale peers from Peers.
Limit number of peers to reduce number of persistent connections.
Manually align structures.
Add macros to generate code for parallel and distributed framework versions.
Add support for provenance.
Replace std::mutex with Spin_mutex in server queues.
Handle cases when a machine has multiple IP addresses.
Introduce ``flags'' field in Basic_kernel. Possible uses: DELETED flag to recursively delete all kernels in queues and in the flight upon Factory::stop().
Make Factory::stop() reliable.
Remove factory_stop() and other global functions.
Make Buffer and LBuffer a subclass of std::streambuf.
Test web socket and socket with random input to cover parsing and other errors.
User defined literals for uint128 and for class metadata.
