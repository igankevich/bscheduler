\mainpage Invitation to Factory

Factory is a framework for developing distributed applications which features
- \ref api "concise API" consisting of a few base classes and a handful of
  global functions and allowing fully asycnhronous execution of your code;
- automatic and transparent fault-tolerance for batch processing applications
  with minimal programmer's intervention;
- automatic bootstrapping of a cluster without prior framework-specific
  configuration and distributed consensus algorithm;
- \ref bottomup "bottom-up programming" approach which makes source code base
  easy to extend an maintain.
